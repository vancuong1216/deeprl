        "To motivate batch normalization, let us review\n",
        "a few practical challenges that arise\n",
        "when training machine learning models and neural networks in particular.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, choices regarding data preprocessing often make an enormous difference in the final results.\n",
        "Recall our application of MLPs to predicting house prices (:numref:`sec_kaggle_house`).\n",
        "Our first step when working with real data\n",
        "was to standardize our input features\n",
        "to each have a mean of zero and variance of one.\n",
        "Intuitively, this standardization plays nicely with our optimizers\n",
        "because it puts the parameters *a priori* at a similar scale.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Second, for a typical MLP or CNN, as we train,\n",
        "the variables (e.g., affine transformation outputs in MLP)\n",
        "in intermediate layers \n",
        "may take values with widely varying magnitudes:\n",
        "both along the layers from the input to the output, across units in the same layer,\n",
        "and over time due to our updates to the model parameters.\n",
        "The inventors of batch normalization postulated informally\n",
        "that this drift in the distribution of such variables could hamper the convergence of the network.\n",
        "Intuitively, we might conjecture that if one\n",
        "layer has variable values that are 100 times that of another layer,\n",
        "this might necessitate compensatory adjustments in the learning rates.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Third, deeper networks are complex and easily capable of overfitting.\n",
        "This means that regularization becomes more critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch normalization is applied to individual layers\n",
        "(optionally, to all of them) and works as follows:\n",
        "In each training iteration,\n",
        "we first normalize the inputs (of batch normalization)\n",
        "by subtracting their mean and\n",
        "dividing by their standard deviation,\n",
        "where both are estimated based on the statistics of the current minibatch.\n",
        "Next, we apply a scale coefficient and a scale offset.\n",
        "It is precisely due to this *normalization* based on *batch* statistics\n",
        "that *batch normalization* derives its name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that if we tried to apply batch normalization with minibatches of size 1,\n",
        "we would not be able to learn anything.\n",
        "That is because after subtracting the means,\n",
        "each hidden unit would take value 0!\n",
        "As you might guess, since we are devoting a whole section to batch normalization,\n",
        "with large enough minibatches, the approach proves effective and stable.\n",
        "One takeaway here is that when applying batch normalization,\n",
        "the choice of batch size may be\n",
        "even more significant than without batch normalization.\n",

        "After applying standardization,\n",
        "the resulting minibatch\n",
        "has zero mean and unit variance.\n",
        "Because the choice of unit variance\n",
        "(vs. some other magic number) is an arbitrary choice,\n",

        "When applying batch normalization to fully-connected layers,\n",
        "the original paper inserts batch normalization after the affine transformation\n",

        "we might need to apply our model to make one prediction at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, after training, we use the entire dataset\n",
        "to compute stable estimates of the variable statistics\n",

        "Even with dropout and weight decay,\n",
        "they remain so flexible that their ability to generalize to unseen data\n",
        "cannot be explained via conventional learning-theoretic generalization guarantees.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the original paper proposing batch normalization,\n",
        "the authors, in addition to introducing a powerful and useful tool,\n",

        "by reducing *internal covariate shift*.\n",

        "i) This drift is very different from *covariate shift*,\n",
        "rendering the name a misnomer.\n",
        "ii) The explanation offers an under-specified intuition\n",
        "but leaves the question of *why precisely this technique works*\n",
        "an open question wanting for a rigorous explanation.\n",
        "Throughout this book, we aim to convey the intuitions that practitioners\n",
        "use to guide their development of deep neural networks.\n",
        "However, we believe that it is important\n",
        "to separate these guiding intuitions\n",
        "from established scientific fact.\n",
        "Eventually, when you master this material\n",
        "and start writing your own research papers\n",

        "Following the success of batch normalization,\n",
        "its explanation in terms of *internal covariate shift*\n",
        "has repeatedly surfaced in debates in the technical literature\n",

        "In a memorable speech given while accepting a Test of Time Award\n",
        "at the 2017 NeurIPS conference,\n",
        "Ali Rahimi used *internal covariate shift*\n",

        "\n",

        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "* During model training, batch normalization continuously adjusts the intermediate output of the neural network by utilizing the mean and standard deviation of the minibatch, so that the values of the intermediate output in each layer throughout the neural network are more stable.\n",
        "* The batch normalization methods for fully-connected layers and convolutional layers are slightly different.\n",
        "* Like a dropout layer, batch normalization layers have different computation results in training mode and prediction mode.\n",
        "* Batch normalization has many beneficial side effects, primarily that of regularization. On the other hand, the original motivation of reducing internal covariate shift seems not to be a valid explanation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Can we remove the bias parameter from the fully-connected layer or the convolutional layer before the batch normalization? Why?\n",
        "1. Compare the learning rates for LeNet with and without batch normalization.\n",
        "    1. Plot the increase in training and test accuracy.\n",
        "    1. How large can you make the learning rate?\n",
        "1. Do we need batch normalization in every layer? Experiment with it?\n",
        "1. Can you replace dropout by batch normalization? How does the behavior change?\n",
        "1. Fix the parameters `beta` and `gamma`, and observe and analyze the results.\n",
        "1. Review the online documentation for `BatchNorm` from the high-level APIs to see the other applications for batch normalization.\n",
        "1. Research ideas: think of other normalization transforms that you can apply? Can you apply the probability integral transform? How about a full rank covariance estimate?\n"
