        "* A CNN is a network that employs convolutional layers.\n",
        "* In a CNN, we interleave convolutions, nonlinearities, and (often) pooling operations.\n",
        "* In a CNN, convolutional layers are typically arranged so that they gradually decrease the spatial resolution of the representations, while increasing the number of channels.\n",
        "* In traditional CNNs, the representations encoded by the convolutional blocks are processed by one or more fully-connected layers prior to emitting output.\n",
